## Allows user to input a value of a dice (d4, d6, d8, etc.) and how many you want to roll. Gives option to reroll. If no reroll is selected it resets ready for new value
## input. Originally I had it so you were forced to choose one of the standard dice values but I found it had more utility if you could use any number for the value. 
## This allows you to roll for things you couldn't with a normal dice set, such as randomizing a d365 if you wanted a random day of the year for example. 

import random

while True: 
    try:
        min = 1
        max = int(input("Enter the highest value of dice to be rolled: "))
    except:
        print("Your input was invalid, program rolled a d20 by default")
        min = 1
        max = 20

    again = True
    number_of_dice = int(input("Enter number of dice to roll: "))

    for i in range(number_of_dice - 1):
        print(random.randint(min, max))

    while again:
        print(random.randint(min, max))

        reroll = input("Roll again? (y/n): ")

        if reroll.lower() == "y" or reroll.lower() == "yes":
            for i in range(number_of_dice - 1):
                print(random.randint(min, max))
        else:
            print("\nWhat dice would you like to roll next?")
            break
